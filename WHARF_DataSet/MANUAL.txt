2.2. Folder types
-----------------
The dataset is organized in folders of three different types:
- [HMP] folders are directly accessible from root and contain all
  the recordings collected for one HMP. The recordings belong to
  different volunteers, they are not syncronized with each other
  and they have different length.
- [HMP]_MODEL folders are located inside the MODELS folder and
  contain 20 recordings, belonging to 5 volunteers, for one HMP.
  The recordings have been synchronized and truncated to have
  equal length.
- [HMP]_sMODEL folders are located inside the MODELS folder and
  contain 4 recordings belonging to a single volunteer for one
  HMP. The recordings have been syncronized and truncated to
  have equal length.


3. Accelerometer specifications
-------------------------------
Type:		   tri-axial accelerometer
Measurement range: [- 1.5g; + 1.5g]
Sensitivity: 	   6 bits per axis
Output data rate:  32 Hz
Location:	   attached to the right wrist of the user with:
		   - x axis: pointing toward the hand
		   - y axis: pointing toward the left
		   - z axis: perpendicular to the plane of the hand


4. Data format
--------------

4.1. File naming convention
---------------------------
Each file in the dataset follows the following naming convention:
Accelerometer-[START_TIME]-[HMP]-[VOLUNTEER]
where:
- [START_TIME]: timestamp of the starting moment of the recording
                in the format [YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS]
- [HMP]:        name of the HMP performed in the recorded trial, following
                the naming convention specified in Section 1 of this manual
- [VOLUNTEER]:  identification code of the volunteer performing the recorded
                motion in the format [g][N] where:
                - "g": indicates the gender of the volunteer
                       (m -> male, f -> female)
                - "N": indicates the progressive number associated to the
                       volunteer

For example the file:
        Accelerometer-2011-03-24-10-24-39-climb_stairs-f1.txt
refers to an accelerometer recording that was taken on March 24, 2011, starting
from 10:24.39 a.m.. The recording refers to the HMP "climb_stairs" executed by
the female volunteer with ID "f1".

Each record of a file reports: 
 - acceleration along the x axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the y axis of the accelerometer 
 - acceleration along the z axis of the accelerometer

4.2 Acceleration data coding
----------------------------
Acceleration data recorded in the dataset are coded according to the
following mapping:
        [0; +63] = [-1.5g; +1.5g]


5. Dataset acquisition details
-------------------------------

5.1 Volunteers
--------------
The dataset is composed of the recordings of selected Human Motion Primitives
perfomed by a total of 17 volunteers. Basic information about the volunteers
are reported in the table below:

| Gender|       Age        |      Weight      |
| M | F | Min | Max | Avg  | Min | Max | Avg  |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| 11| 6 | 19  | 81  | 57.4 | 56  | 85  | 72.7 |

5.2 Hardware setup
------------------
The tri-axial accelerometer is embedded in an ad-hoc sensing device
(40mm x 22mm x 12mm) that is attached at the right wrist of the user.
Data transmission to the PC is wired, via a USB cable.
